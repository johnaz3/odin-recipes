# odin-recipes
Will create a recipe website listing three of my favorite foods images of them ingredients required and steps how to make them
This exercise will make sure I know how to
    - Make html boilerplates
    - Make unordered and ordered list and differentiate which ones i should use
    - Establish anchor elements that use relative links
    - Show images
